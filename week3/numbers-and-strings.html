  <h1>HTML5 APIs Assignment 3: Numbers and Strings</h1>
  <p>Create a Web page with a textarea input field where the user enters numbers or text.</p>
  <p>Each time the user submits the input, check whether it is a number. If it is a number, update the display to show how many numbers have been entered, the sum of the numbers, and the average of the numbers. If it is a string, concatenate it onto all of the other strings that have been entered, and display the number of strings that have been entered and the accumulated concatenation.</p>
  <p>There should be a Reset button that allows the user to start over with a new sequence of numbers.</p>
  <p>Optional feature: Determine, update, and display the frequency of words entered in the strings. Hints: Use an object where the property keys (names) will be the words you find, and the property values will be the number of times each is encountered. Split a string into an array of words. For each word in the array, if the word is already a property name, increment its value. Otherwise set the value to 1. To display the frequencies, get the object's keys and make a row in a table for each one.</p>
